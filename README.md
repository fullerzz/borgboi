# BorgBoi üë¶üèº

Wrapper around [Borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to ease the process of taking automated backups for my personal systems.

The Borg repository can be synced with an S3 bucket as part of the daily backup operation, or used in offline mode without cloud services.

## Usage

The program can be invoked with: `borgboi <cmd>` or `bb <cmd>`

### Take Daily Backup

```bash
borgboi daily-backup <path-to-repo>
```

### Offline Mode

BorgBoi supports offline mode for users who prefer not to use AWS services:

```bash
# Enable offline mode with environment variable
export BORGBOI_OFFLINE=1
bb create-repo --repo-path /opt/borg-repos/docs --backup-target ~/Documents

# Or use the --offline flag
bb daily-backup --repo-path /opt/borg-repos/docs --offline
```
